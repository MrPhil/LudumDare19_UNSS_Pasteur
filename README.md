# Ludum Dare 19 - UNSS Pasteur
This is the repo tagged "Final" and I assume that means it was the codr that was submitted tothe compo.  Oopps, I did this backwards, I copy/created the truck first and then branched the "CompoFinal" and copy the final tag over to it.

Ludum Dare 19 compo entry (this repo was ported from an old svn server)
